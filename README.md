### 🚦 Project Goals

* Apply computer vision to detect and count vehicles per lane.
* Use adaptive scheduling for green/red traffic lights based on vehicle density.
* Export models for edge deployment using **ONNX** and **TensorRT**.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* YOLOv5s (for fast, lightweight object detection)
* ONNX Runtime

## 🚀 My Contributions

I built upon the original open-source research by:

* 🔧 **Improving and optimizing the core algorithm** for better vehicle detection accuracy and adaptive timing logic.
* ⚙️ **Focusing on CPU and GPU-based inference using ONNX Runtime**, enabling deployment on a wider range of hardware without relying on specialized accelerators like TensorRT.
* 📦 **Streamlining the model export and deployment workflow**, especially for environments where GPU inference is possible but TensorRT is not practical.
* 🧪 **Benchmarking performance** and ensuring efficient real-time operation on both CPU and GPU setups.

These contributions enhance accessibility, deployment flexibility, and encourage further open-source collaboration.
